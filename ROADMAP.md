## Current Output

Running `human build examples/taskflow/app.human` produces **77 files** (React + Node stack). File count varies by stack:

| Generator | Files | Output |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| React + TypeScript | 13 | Types, API client, pages, components, router, Vite config, Tailwind |
| Vue + TypeScript | 16 | Components, pages, router, API, types, Pinia stores |
| Angular + TypeScript | 20 | Components, services, routing, signals, environments |
| Svelte + TypeScript | 19 | Pages, components, stores, SvelteKit routing |
| Node + Express | 19 | Prisma schema, auth + authorize middleware, policies, route handlers, integration services, server |
| Python + FastAPI | 11 | SQLAlchemy models, routes, auth, Alembic migrations, main app |
| Go + Gin | 10 | Handlers, routes, GORM models, auth middleware, go.mod |
| Docker + Compose | 5 | Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml, .env.example, package.json |
| PostgreSQL | 2 | Migration (001_initial.sql), seed data |
| CI/CD | 6 | GitHub Actions workflows (test, build, deploy per environment) |
| Terraform | 10 | AWS ECS/RDS or GCP Cloud Run/SQL modules, variables, outputs |
| Monitoring | 8 | Prometheus alert rules, Grafana dashboard JSON |
| Architecture | 2-10 | Service topology, deployment diagrams (varies by architecture) |

All generators are wired into the CLI. The scaffolder adapts to the selected stack — only files relevant to the chosen frontend/backend are generated.

- 🔄 **Runtime correctness hardening** — end-to-end `docker compose up` validation, `tsc --noEmit` clean across all stacks
- 🔜 **Display statement intelligence** — smarter JSX/template generation from natural language descriptions
- 🔜 **Plugin system** — community-extensible code generators and integration adapters
- 🔜 **Human Cloud** — hosted builds (upload `.human`, get deployed app)

## Principles Throughout

1. **Every phase produces something that works.** No phase is "just infrastructure."
2. **Test everything.** The compiler for a quality-enforced language must itself be well-tested.
3. **Error messages are a feature.** Every error helps the developer fix the problem.
4. **Determinism is sacred.** Same input, same output, always.
5. **Ship examples.** Every feature comes with a .human example that demonstrates it.
