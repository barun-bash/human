```
app TaskFlow is a web application

data User:
  has a name which is text
  has an email which is unique email
  has a password which is encrypted text

data Task:
  belongs to a User
  has a title which is text
  has a status which is either "pending" or "done"
  has a due date

page Dashboard:
  show a list of tasks sorted by due date
  each task shows its title, status, and due date
  clicking a task toggles its status
  if no tasks match, show "No tasks found"

api CreateTask:
  requires authentication
  accepts title and due date
  check that title is not empty
  create the task for the current user
  respond with the created task

authentication:
  method JWT tokens that expire in 7 days

build with:
  frontend using React with TypeScript
  backend using Node with Express
  database using PostgreSQL
```

That's a **complete, deployable application.** No semicolons. No imports. No framework knowledge required.

## What is Human?

Human is a natural language programming language that compiles structured English into production-ready, full-stack applications. The compiler is deterministic, target-agnostic, and enforces mandatory quality guarantees on every build.

- **English is the syntax** — if you can describe what you want, you can build it.
- **Design files are input** — feed it Figma files, images, or screenshots alongside your `.human` code.
- **Output is real code** — React, Angular, Vue, Node, Python, Go, and more.
- **Quality is mandatory** — tests, security audit, code quality, and QA trail are compiler-enforced. Cannot be skipped.
- **Compilation is deterministic** — same `.human` file always produces the same output. No randomness.
- **Ejectable** — generated code is clean, readable, and fully owned by you.
- **LLM-optional** — core compiler works offline with zero AI dependency. LLM connector available as an optional enhancement.

## How It Works

```
.human files + designs
         │
    ┌────▼────┐
    │  Lexer  │    Tokenizes English into structured tokens
    └────┬────┘
         │
    ┌────▼────┐
    │ Parser  │    Builds abstract syntax tree
    └────┬────┘
         │
    ┌────▼──────┐
    │ Analyzer  │  Validates semantics, resolves references
    └────┬──────┘
         │
    ┌────▼─────┐
    │ Intent   │   Framework-agnostic intermediate representation
    │ IR       │   (the heart of the compiler)
    └────┬─────┘
         │
    ┌────▼────────────────────┐
    │ Code Generators         │
    │ React │ Angular │ Vue   │
    │ Node  │ Python  │ Go    │
    │ Docker│ Terraform│ CI/CD│
    └────┬────────────────────┘
         │
    ┌────▼─────────┐
    │ Quality      │   Tests + Security + Lint + QA
    │ Engine       │   (mandatory on every build)
    └──────────────┘
         │
         ▼
    Production-ready code
```

The **Intent IR** is the key innovation — a typed, serializable, framework-agnostic representation that sits between your Human source and generated code. Write once, compile to any supported target.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# One-liner (macOS / Linux)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barun-bash/human/main/install.sh | sh

# Homebrew
brew install barun-bash/tap/human

# Go install (requires Go 1.25+)
go install github.com/barun-bash/human/cmd/human@latest

# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/barun-bash/human.git
cd human && make install
```

### Usage

```bash
# Validate a .human file
human check examples/taskflow/app.human

# Compile to a full-stack project
human build examples/taskflow/app.human

# Run the generated project
cd .human/output && bash start.sh
```

## Supported Targets

| Layer | Implemented | Planned |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | React, Angular, Vue, Svelte (all with TypeScript) | HTMX |
| **Backend** | Node + Express, Python + FastAPI, Go + Gin | Rust (Axum), Django |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite |
| **Infra** | Docker + Compose, Terraform (AWS ECS/RDS, GCP Cloud Run/SQL), GitHub Actions CI/CD | Kubernetes, Vercel, AWS Lambda |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus rules, Grafana dashboards | — |
| **Integrations** | Stripe, SendGrid, AWS S3, OAuth (Google/GitHub), Slack | — |
| **Design Systems** | Material UI, Shadcn/ui, Ant Design, Chakra UI, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Untitled UI | — |

## Mandatory Quality System

Every `human build` enforces all four pillars. These are not optional.

| Pillar | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Automatic Tests** | Unit, integration, edge case, and frontend tests generated from your declarations. 90% minimum coverage. Build fails below threshold. |
| **Security Audit** | Dependency vulnerability scan, input sanitization, auth/authz checks, secret detection, infrastructure security review. |
| **Code Quality** | Consistent formatting, no dead code, duplication detection, performance pattern analysis, accessibility compliance. |
| **QA Trail** | Test plans from specs, execution records per build, regression tracking, full traceability from requirement to test to security to QA. |
